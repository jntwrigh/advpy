                                This task creates a NumPy array using specified
                                requirements from the student materials.

                                This exercise several parts:
                                1. Create a function that returns an n x n array,
                                   where n is the height/width of a 2D array.  Each
                                   row should be enumerated from 1 to n.

                                2. Modify the function to support a start (initial) and
                                   stop (end) value instead of always starting at 1.

                                3. Modify the function again to return on "middle values."

                                4. Create a second function to return an array of similar
                                   shape and size as the one returned in the previous step,
                                   but this time fill it will all the same value.

                                For each of these parts, it is best to refer to the student
                                materials as they provide a visual representation of the desired results.

"""


# Part 1 - Create an n x n array where each row has a sequentially increasing value starting from 1 up to n
#
# Hints: a) create a function that accepts an argument, n
#        b) within the function create an array that increases sequentially up to n
#        c) repeat this row n times
#        d) return the resulting array
#        e) display the array


# Part 2 - Refactor the function you just created to support a start and stop argument.  Use the start and stop values
# to create the function.  Refer to the slide in the student manual for a visual representation of these requirements.



# Part 3 - Refactor the function one last time, this time returning, not the entire array, but instead just
# array values that aren't on the outer rows or columns.  In other words use slicing to return only "middle values."



# Part 4 - Create a second function that returns an array that has the same shape/size of the array returned from
# part 3 above.  This array can be filled with any value you desire.
